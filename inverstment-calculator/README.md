# Investment Calculator

This project is a simple investment calculator that allows users to enter financial details and view calculated results dynamically.  
The goal of this project is to understand how data flows between components in React and how user input affects application state.

## Concepts Learned

- Implementing two-way data binding using input fields and state  
- Managing component state effectively  
- Lifting state up to share data between multiple components  
- Rendering calculated results in a structured list format  
- Conditionally displaying output based on user input  

## What This Project Showcases

This project showcases how React handles user input, state management, and dynamic UI updates.  
It demonstrates how components communicate with each other and how results can be displayed conditionally depending on the entered data.

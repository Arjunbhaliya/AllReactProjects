# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built to practice state management and component interaction in React.  
The goal is to understand how game logic connects with UI updates and how components work together.

## Concepts Learned

- Working with components in isolation  
- Implementing two-way data binding for player input  
- Lifting state up to manage shared game data  
- Rendering a multidimensional list for the game board  
- Displaying conditional content based on game state  
- Disabling buttons conditionally after selection  
- Showing a game-over screen using the HTML `dialog` element  

## What This Project Showcases

This project showcases how to manage game state, handle user interactions, and dynamically update the UI.  
It demonstrates conditional rendering, structured data handling, and clean separation of logic across components.

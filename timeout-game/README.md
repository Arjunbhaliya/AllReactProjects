# Timeout Game

This project is a small interactive game where the user tries to stop a timer at the correct moment.  
The purpose of this project is to understand timing functions, state management, and advanced React patterns.

## Concepts Learned

- Implementing two-way data binding for user input  
- Accessing and controlling HTML elements using `useRef`  
- Understanding the difference between `ref` and `state`  
- Using `setInterval` and `clearInterval` to control the game timer  
- Sharing state across multiple components  
- Displaying a result modal based on game outcome  
- Rendering the modal using React Portal  

## What This Project Showcases

This project showcases how to manage time-based logic inside a React application.  
It demonstrates clean separation of UI and logic, proper use of refs, and how to render components outside the normal DOM hierarchy using portals.
